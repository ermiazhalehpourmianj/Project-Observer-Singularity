# OS Collapse Streamlit Dashboard

Run the interactive dashboard to explore collapse parameters and visibilities:

```bash
streamlit run app/os_dashboard.py
```

Use the sidebar controls to adjust mass, separation, λ, time range, and sampling density. The app reports ΔE_G, Γ_col, τ_c, and plots V_OS(t) alongside the flat V_QM(t) baseline.
