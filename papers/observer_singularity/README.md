# Observer–Singularity Paper

This folder will contain the LaTeX or Markdown source for **Paper 1: Observer–Singularity: Covariant Final-State Constraints and Gravitationally Weighted Collapse**. The final PDF will be added once the draft is ready for submission.

Planned contents:
- `outline.md` — high-level structure and section headings.
- `drafts/` — in-progress versions of the manuscript.
