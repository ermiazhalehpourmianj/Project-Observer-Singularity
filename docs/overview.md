# Overview

Project Singularity is an integrated research effort exploring how gravity-weighted collapse dynamics intersect with observer-centric phenomenology. It is organized around two complementary threads: a physics-forward treatment of collapse and a phenomenological study of observer geometry.

The **Observer–Singularity** component develops a gravity-weighted collapse model inspired by Diósi–Penrose ideas, introducing covariant final-state constraints and testing how collapse rates depend on gravitational self-energy. In parallel, the **Observer Geometry** thread analyzes feedback loops, frequency, and experiential geometry to contextualize how observers shape and are shaped by measurement outcomes. The two perspectives remain distinct and are captured in separate papers to keep derivations and phenomenology cleanly scoped.

This repository hosts the code scaffolding for toy simulations, outlines for both papers, and will eventually include finalized PDFs and analysis artifacts. Heavy physics implementations and completed drafts will be added as the project matures.
