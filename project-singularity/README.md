# Project Singularity

Project Singularity is a two-paper research program exploring gravity-weighted collapse and observer-centered geometry. It contains:

- **Paper 1:** A gravity-weighted collapse model (Observer–Singularity / OS model) addressing the quantum measurement problem.
- **Paper 2:** An Observer Geometry framework modeling feedback loops, frequency, and the geometry of lived experience (loops, toroids, patterns).
- A Python toolkit for toy simulations of OS-style collapse.
- Paper folders with outlines and future drafts.
- Experiment design notes and placeholders for future analysis.

## Project layout
- `docs/` — overview and roadmap documentation.
- `python/os_gravity_collapse/` — Python toolkit skeleton for OS-style collapse modeling and plotting.
- `papers/` — outlines and future drafts for both papers.
- `experiments/` — design concepts and analysis placeholders.
- `tools/` — helper scripts and utilities (future).

## Roadmap
- Implement OS collapse calculator (ΔE_G, Γ_col, τ_c, visibility).
- Add experimental parameter scan tools.
- Finalize and add PDFs of both papers.
- Document experimental results when available.
