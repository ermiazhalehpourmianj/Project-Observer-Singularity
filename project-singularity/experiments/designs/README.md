# Experiment Designs

This folder will collect thought experiments and real experimental proposals where the Observer–Singularity model might diverge from standard quantum mechanics (e.g., mesoscopic interferometry, gravitational decoherence regimes).

Template files to be added:
- `interferometer_mass_scan.md`
- `optomechanical_experiment.md`
