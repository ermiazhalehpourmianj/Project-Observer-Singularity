# Observer Geometry Paper

This folder contains materials for **Paper 2: Observer Geometry: Frequency, Feedback Loops, and the Lived Structure of Reality**. The focus is on feedback loops, frequency, patterns, gamma states, and experiential geometry. It will reference but not duplicate the hard physics developed in Paper 1.

Planned contents:
- `outline.md` — high-level structure and section headings.
- Additional drafts or figures to be added later.
